# AGON_DEMO_10_DRAWTEXT2
Agon Light 2 Demo draw text and scale Part2<br>

A better way to draw letters/words and scale them.
I used a 16x64 pixel grid to create my letters then did all draw and move commands based off the bottom left corner being 0,0.
Then added the scaling.<br>

A HUGE THANKS TO MILTONW <br>
for the code, It's all his work.<br>

And Luis From Learn Agon for his Ferrari code.
